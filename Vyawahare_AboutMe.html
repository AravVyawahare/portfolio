           <p class="fade2s">Hello, my name is Arav Vyawahare and I am a freshman in Dublin High School. 
           I was born here in California and my parents immigrated from India. 
           In school I am taking Computer Science/ Engineering along with the other, normal classes. 
           I am very excited to learn code in this class using any experience that I've learned before I came to high school. 
           Attending Dublin High School was a huge, new experience which I still need to get used to. 
           I hope to get into bigger clubs with great academic achievery and learning. And I would plan to join clubs for volunteering benefits.
           I'm going for the advanced diploma and it's never too early to start working now.
           My hobbies include coding, video games, sports, hanging out with friends, and reading non-fiction science and biography.
           Overall, my classes are great, I like my teachers, and can't wait to see what my high school career is going to show me in the next few years. </p>
